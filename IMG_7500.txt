My practice pairs digital fabrication with traditional methods of making, harnessing the precision of computer-aided design and the nuance of the human hand. When I entered the MFA program at CU, I had only recently discovered digital fabrication. Jeanne Quinn deepened my knowledge of this technique, helping me see new avenues for making.
For this piece, I cut layers of plywood using a CNC- milling machine. In the resulting panel, I inlaid blue ceramic shapes cut from commercial tile. My work and this piece are influenced by weekly drawing exercises with Scott Chamberlin and critical conversations with Kim Dickey about ornament. My practice echoes the care and guidance these dedicated artists and educators gave me during my time at CU.
